# RPi-based Observatory Controller

An automated astronomical observatory needs at least one observatory controller
running a server application that bridges network clients with the individual
controller units (such as CCD, telescope mount, dome, meteo station) connected
to the observatory controller via local interfaces.

Some observatories tend to use an older decommissioned PC box that is powerful
enough to act as an observatory controller.  It is apparent that this approach
is not just a technical overkill.  It is a catastrophe in terms of power
consumption, fire risks and resistance to the extreme environmental conditions.

With Raspberry Pi it is tremendously easy to build compact, reliable and cheap
observatory controller.
